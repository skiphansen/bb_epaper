This is a fork of Larry Bank's [bb_epaper](https://github.com/bitbank2/bb_epaper) library with modifications for use
on various surplus electronic price tags for the OEPL project.

Please see [Larry's master repo](https://github.com/bitbank2/bb_epaper) for licensing terms and full documentation.

Changes in this fork:
1. Target bare metal (no Arduino framework, no Linux headers, no OS) platforms.
2. Addition of reverse engineered display types that support displays encountered on surplus electronic price tags.
